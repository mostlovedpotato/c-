Here in this question we are given many things which are having different lengths we are to given the 
maximum length occurences we have to find the corresponding max length.
given array of things of size n things in it and integer k
at least k peices of same length needs to be obtained or cut from
given item lengths.The task is to find the maximum length of these
k things that can be obtained. 
All things can be cut .

#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool isT(int wood[], int N, int len, int k) {
	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++){
		count += wood[i] / len;
}
	return count >= k;
}

int maxLen(int wood[], int N, int k) {
	int l = 1;
	int r = *max_element(wood, wood + N);
	while (l <= r) {
		int mid = l + (r - 1) / 2;
		if (isT(wood, N, mid, k)) {
			l = mid + 1;
		}
		else {
			r = mid - 1;
		}
	}
	return r;
}

int main() {
	int wood[100];
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> wood[i];
	}
	cout << maxLen(wood, n, k);
	return 0;
}
