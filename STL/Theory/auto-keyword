Using auto can be quite easy and might help us to reduce the code length and also to make it clearer to understand.

No with c++11, you can declare a variable or an object without specifying its specific type by using
auto.1 For example:
auto i = 42; // i has type int
double f();
auto d = f(); // d has type double

But for the use of auto while declaration we have to declare that variable we can't just initialize and leave it.

auto i; // ERROR: canâ€™t dedulce the type of i

and also additional qualifiers are allowed 
static auto vat = 0.19;

Using auto is especially useful where the type is a pretty long and/or complicated expression. For
example:
vector<string> v;
...
auto pos = v.begin(); // pos has type vector<string>::iterator
auto l = [] (int x) -> bool { // l has the type of a lambda
..., // taking an int and returning a bool
};
