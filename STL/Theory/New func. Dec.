Sometimes, the return type of a function depends on an expression processed with the arguments.
However, something like
template <typename T1, typename T2>
decltype(x+y) add(T1 x, T2 y);
was not possible before C++11, because the return expression uses objects not introduced or in scope
yet.
But with C++11, you can alternatively declare the return type of a function behind the parameter
list:
template <typename T1, typename T2>
auto add(T1 x, T2 y) -> decltype(x+y);
