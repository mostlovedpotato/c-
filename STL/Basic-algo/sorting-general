Basic syntax for this is simply : sort(startaddress, endaddress)
Mathematically speaking it is more likely to be [startaddress,endaddress)   where first element is included while the last element is not.

#include <iostream> 
#include <algorithm> 
  
using namespace std; 
  
void show(int a[]) 
{ 
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) 
        cout << a[i] << " "; 
} 
  
int main() 
{ 
    int a[10] ;
    cout<<"Enter the elements into the array<<endl;
    for(int i = 0;i<10;i++)
    {
      cin>>a[i];
    }
    cout << "\n The array before sorting is : "; 
    show(a); 
  
    sort(a, a+10); 
  
    cout << "\n\n The array after sorting is : "; 
    show(a); 
  
    return 0; 
  
}
