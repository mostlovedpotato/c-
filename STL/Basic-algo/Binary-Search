Binary search is a widely used searching algorithm that requires the array to be sorted before search is applied.
So the main idea is go on dividing the array into halves until we get to the number or element we are searching.

General syntax is like : binary_search(startaddress, endaddress, valuetofind)


#include <algorithm> 
#include <iostream> 

using namespace std; 

void show(int a[], int arraysize) 
{ 
	for (int i = 0; i < arraysize; ++i) 
		cout << a[i] << " "; 
} 

int main() 
{ 
	int a[] = { 1, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 0 }; 
	int asize = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]); 
	cout << "\n The array is : "; 
	show(a, asize); 
  cout << "\n\nwe want to search for 10"; 
	if (binary_search(a, a + 10, 10)) 
		cout << "\nElement found in the array"; 
	else
		cout << "\nElement not found in the array"; 

	return 0; 
}
